# Vector ansible role

This is an ansible role to set up [vector](https://vector.dev).
It translates the YAML configuration to TOML, so any configuration is possible.

For available variables check out [defaults](roles/vector/defaults/main.yml)

Currently only amd64, arch64, arch7 through deb and rpm packages are supported
